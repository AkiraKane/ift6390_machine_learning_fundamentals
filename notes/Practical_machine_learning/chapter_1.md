to learn:


- get knowledge of something by study, experience, or being taught.
- become aware by information or from observation

it is virtually impossible to test whether learning has been achieved
or not. How do you know whether a machine has got knowledge of something? You
probably can’t just ask it questions; even if you could, you wouldn’t be testing its
ability to learn but its ability to answer questions. How do you know whether it has
become aware of something? The whole question of whether computers can be
aware, or conscious, is a burning philosophical issue.


- commit to memory
- be informed of or to ascertain
- receive instruction


although we can see what they denote in human
terms, merely committing to memory and receiving instruction seem to fall far short
of what we might mean by machine learning. They are too passive, and we know
that computers find these tasks trivial. Instead, we are interested in improvements
in performance, or at least in the potential for performance, in new situations. You
can commit something to memory or be informed of something by rote learning
without being able to apply the new knowledge to new situations. In other words,
you can receive instruction without benefiting from it at all.


The output of learning could be rules.
